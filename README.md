## About The Project

I am one who either uses one password to conquer them all or forgets all of them when I deviate from what I'm used to, nothing in between.
I created this project as I can see myself using it often, thus I can nitpick the stuff I want to improve or better the UI, perfomance, or
interaction. 

I plan to include a docker-compose on to it so other people/devs can nitpick it as well and improve.
